# Post-Task Workflow

## Build Verification

**IMPORTANT**: After completing any coding task, always run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This ensures:
- No TypeScript errors
- No build-time errors
- All imports are valid
- The application compiles successfully

**Do not consider a task complete until `yarn build` passes successfully.**

## Development Commands

```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn start        # Start production server
yarn lint         # Run ESLint
```

## Database Commands

```bash
yarn db:generate  # Generate Drizzle migrations
yarn db:migrate   # Run migrations
yarn db:push      # Push schema changes (dev only)
yarn db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
```

## Common Checks Before Completing Work

1. Run `yarn build` - must pass with no errors
2. Check for TypeScript errors in the editor
3. Verify imports are using `@/` alias correctly
4. Ensure "use client" directive is added where needed
5. Confirm API routes use `requireAuth()` for protected endpoints
